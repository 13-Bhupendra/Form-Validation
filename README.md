 # Form Validation using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and RegEx

## Overview
This project is a simple form validation system built using **HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, and Regular Expressions (RegEx)**. The form includes fields for **Username, Email, Password, and Confirm Password**, along with real-time error messages when the user inputs incorrect details.

## Features
- Username validation (Only letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens; 3-32 characters)
- Email validation (Must be in a valid email format)
- Password validation (Minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, and numbers)
- Confirm password validation (Checks if passwords match)
- Dynamic error messages for incorrect inputs
- Fully styled using CSS

## How It Works
1. When the user enters their details and clicks the **Login** button, JavaScript (jQuery) checks the input fields.
2. **Username validation** ensures that only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens are used (3-32 characters).
3. **Email validation** checks if the input follows a valid email format.
4. **Password validation** ensures that the password is at least 8 characters long and contains uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
5. **Confirm Password validation** ensures the password matches the confirmation field.
6. If an error is found, an appropriate message is displayed under the respective input field.
7. If all inputs are correct, a success message is shown.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the form
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript (jQuery)** for handling validation logic
- **RegEx (Regular Expressions)** for input validation

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter details in the form fields.
4. Click the **Login** button to validate inputs.
5. If the details are incorrect, error messages will be displayed.
6. If the details are correct, a success message appears.
